The game starts with some dialogue to explain the task to the player. It's a platform game where the player has to jump onto platforms and climb to the top. The platforms may have collectables that will power up the characters if they come into contact with them. There are also monsters that the player either has to avoid or kill. The monsters will only spawn depending on the level. There are multiple levels of difficulty for the game: easy, medium and hard. The harder the level, the more the player has to climb and the harder the enemies. 

The narrative is that thereâ€™s a prophecy of the island volcano erupting and destroying the island. To prevent this the player is assigned a task by the island leader to collect a long-lost artefact from the top of the volcano. The artefact is significant as it belonged to an ancient god and is rumoured to be able to manipulate the elements. This includes being able to manipulate the lava that should erupt from the volcano. The player has to climb to the top of this volcano to collect it and prevent the island from being destroyed.
